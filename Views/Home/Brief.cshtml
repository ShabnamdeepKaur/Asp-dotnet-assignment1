                    workers, including painters, plumbers, maids,
                    and carpenters. As an alternative, the worker can identify work that has been offered by someone in

                    This website will bridge the gap between job seekers/workers and service providers/customers in
                    various industries. It will
                    provide a platform for job listings, worker profiles, and job matching, making it easier for both
                    job seekers and employers to
                    find suitable opportunities or workers. This type of platform can be particularly useful in the gig
                    economy, where flexible
                    employment arrangements are common.

                    Three dashboards, namely Worker, Citizen, and Admin, will be available on this website. Both the
                    employee and the citizen must
                    sign in, fill up profile forms, publish criteria, and look for employment individually. Both
                    dashboards will be accessible to
                    the administrator.
